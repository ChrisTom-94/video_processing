# Mouvement estimation in video sequences

## Description

This project is about motion estimation in video sequences. We will use different algorithms to estimate the motion between two frames. The goal is to compare the different algorithms and make analysis about their performances and their limitations.

## Algorithms

- Background substraction
- Frame differencing
- Motion history image (MHI)
- Optical flow
